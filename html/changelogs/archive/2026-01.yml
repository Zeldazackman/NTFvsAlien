  - balance: Xurrender/xumbit applies godmode to xenos.
  - balance: Surrender/sumbit/xurrender/xumbit no longer applies godmode in war modes.
  - balance: Nonlethals no longer damage xeno's plasma. They fill up their stun bar
      instead.
  - rscadd: Stun bar added for xenos, which paralyzes them for 9 seconds if it gets
      filled up. It regenerates the same way health does, and its maximum depends
      on xeno's current health. The more damaged xeno is, the easier it is to take
      them down.
  - rscadd: Added new shackles item to req, which can be used to restrain xenomorphs
      and block their abilities.

  EaglePhntm:
  - rscadd: Added resin sacks and bodysuit stuff
  - bugfix: nests now give pleasure, no longer caretake their victims and they instead
      inject acid in time, they are no longer put marine and forget 1x1 room hellholes,
      they'll end up dying and becoming useless without supervising, use regular nests
      for keeping people, tentacle for fun and traps. Also tentacles only take 1 second
      with a cooldown of (30 seconds on fail) to catch people who walk over them instead
      of 10 now so dont stay on it, proper trap.
  Nokia2Student:
  - balance: All nonlethals no longer drain both plasma and stun bar, only some target
      both.
  - balance: Stun bar regeneration penalty was removed when low on health/plasma.
