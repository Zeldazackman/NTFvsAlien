  - balance: Xurrender/xumbit applies godmode to xenos.
  - balance: Surrender/sumbit/xurrender/xumbit no longer applies godmode in war modes.
  - balance: Nonlethals no longer damage xeno's plasma. They fill up their stun bar
      instead.
  - rscadd: Stun bar added for xenos, which paralyzes them for 9 seconds if it gets
      filled up. It regenerates the same way health does, and its maximum depends
      on xeno's current health. The more damaged xeno is, the easier it is to take
      them down.
  - rscadd: Added new shackles item to req, which can be used to restrain xenomorphs
      and block their abilities.
