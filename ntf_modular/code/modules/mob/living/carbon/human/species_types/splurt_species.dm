	The Akula are a species of humanoids that were created by the Syndicate in some old Novamed slums laboratory as a failed attempt to create a inter-continental shock troop or infiltrator.<br /><br /> \
	First Akulas escaped their captors and fled to the wilderness and to oceans, where they lived in small packs as hunters and scavengers, until they were eventually found by Novamed marine researchers and brought into society as proper citizens in turn for loyalty.<br /><br /> \
	<b>Physiology</b>:<br /><br /> \
	Akulas have a layer of blubber under their skin that makes them more resistant to cold and heat, They also have sharper claws and teeth than normal humans, They are also very sensitive to taste, able to distinguish between different flavors with great precision.<br /><br /> \
	They have shark-like features, which lets them swim efficiently in water.<br /><br /><br /><br /> \
	<b>Psychology</b>:<br /><br /> \
	Akulas are a proud and fierce species, they have a strong sense of loyalty to their pack and to those they consider family. They can be aggressive and territorial, but they are also capable of great compassion and empathy towards those they care about.<br /><br /> \

	Result of few years of totally ethical xenomorph research of collective corporate research. They are hybirdisation of humanoid species and xenomorphs.<br /><br /> \
	<b>Physiology</b>:<br /><br /> \
	They are much like humans but are slightly more suspectible to burn damage, but they can use their tail to sting their enemies with aphrotoxin or neurotoxin and can use their physiology to speak in the xenomorph language.<br /><br /> \
	<b>Psychology</b>:<br /><br /> \
	Xenomorph hybrids are a complex species that were man-made, they usually behave similiar to xenomorphs but take their faction for their 'hive'. But it varies, they could be acting more human instead.<br /><br /> \
	<br /><br /><b>Mechanics:</b><br /><br /> \
	-Xenomorph-<br /><br /> \
	Xenomorph hybrids can use their hybrid physique to do a variety of maneuvers, from biting to tail swing that injects aphrotoxin or neurotoxin.<br /><br /> \
	-Exoskeleton-<br /><br /> \
	Xenomorph hybrids have a tough exoskeleton that provides them with some brute protection.<br /><br /> \
	-Fire Weakness-<br /><br /> \
	Xenomorph hybrids have a slight weakness to fire damage."
